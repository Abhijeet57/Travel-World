The Museum of Fine Arts offers a fine permanent collection from the masters of American painting as well as a vast selection of works of art from all important periods; it also hosts special exhibits on loan from around the world.
			The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston is a world-renowned institution housing one of the best art collections in the world. The collection encompasses more than 450,000 individual pieces dating from ancient Egypt until the 20th century. The family-friendly museum has several hands-on art programs geared toward children to make their visit fun and exciting.
